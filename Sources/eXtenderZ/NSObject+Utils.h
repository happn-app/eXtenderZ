 Convenient method to get associated object with automatic creation if the object does not exist.
 
 If the block is @c NULL@endc, the object is not auto-created.
 In case the object must be created, it is created using the creator block, then associated to the object with the given association policy.
 
 The return value wonâ€™t necessarily be the object returned by the creator block (in case for instance the association policy is @c OBJC_ASSOCIATION_COPY@endc).
